# Blog app

This app is based on the Odin Projects 4th last Node project.
The goal is to practice creating a backend api, then interact with the api through 2 separate frontends. See the Backend README for more info.

### Goals

- API security. managing protected routes through JWT's
- Practice sending JSON data to be consumed by a separate frontend. up till now the back end was serving webpages through EJS.
- More practice using the prisma ORM and Postgres.
